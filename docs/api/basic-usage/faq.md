## How do I keep my tokens refreshed all the time, even across app restarts?

Persist the access token together with the refresh token and expiry time somewhere, and load this when your app starts.

You can find a basic example showing how this works in the [@twurple/chat documentation](/docs/chat/examples/basic-bot).

## I have more questions! Where do I get help?
